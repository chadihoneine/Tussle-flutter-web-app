        "From twerking to wine tasting, thereâ€™s an online class for almost everything. Extra points to consider for a virtual class are whether you need to send out samples (for food or drink tastings), if your students need any special tools (for a cookery or pottery class), and how well your technology works. For example, you may need to invest in higher-quality audio devices so that attendees can clearly hear you.",
